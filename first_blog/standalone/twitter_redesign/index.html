<span class="extra">&#60;marquee&#62; tag is evil</span>

Its always good to start up with an image :P</p>
<p>So as expected, the new twitter home page is here, and along has come a Tsunami of thoughts in my curious brain. Why the fuck did they use the marquee tag ?</p>
<p>Its a small lot, so I'm classifying all I need to say under <strong>&#8220; Yack ! &#8221;</strong> and <strong>&#8220; not so yack ! &#8221;</strong></p>
<p>
<ul>
<li><strong>The Yacks of new design</strong><ol><li>
All I found was just one, the marquee tag sucks. Earlier all trending topics were browsable at once, but now we need to wait and look at the horrible text. Ridiculous.
-3 for this.</li>
<li><del>That's it</del>
</li></ol></li>
<li><br/></li>
<li><strong>The not so Yacks !</strong><ol>
<li>The color combinations is pretty safe and usual. +0 as nothing new.</li>
<li>The search box is powered with a really cool hover effect, something I've never seen before so +2 for that</li>
<li>Top tweets as Live on <a href="http://www.gowalla.com" title="Gowalla" target="_blank">http://www.gowalla.com</a> nothing new, yet looks good. Another +1 for it.</li>
<li>Look who is here looks nice as well. Good for attracting new users. And the get started now button is OK. Good enough to get another <del>+1</del> +2 rather.</li>
</ol></li>
<li>
<h3>Conclusion</h3>
Remove the marquee, you rock. Keep it the way it is &#8220; Boooo! &#8221;
</li>
</ul>
