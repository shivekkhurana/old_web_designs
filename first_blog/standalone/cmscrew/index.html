I forgot to mention that I hate .php. Don't know why. Its like my soul speaking to me that &#8220; php monster will tear your brain tonight &#8221;.
But still as said in my previous article, I gave php powered CMS-es a decent try. My options were very limited as php was all I could opt for (my free host doesn't allow
python)
</p>

<p>
The outcome was similar to a vague expectation. I SCREWED IT. I just gave it up, something I usually don't do. What I did was enough to pump up my curious brain 
to think what happened. The main reason I found was <del>bad</del> poor .php background. I'm not capable of coding even a single line of php. I gained very valuable
experience in <del>these</del> those 49 hours over 2 days. Enough for me righting a review. But I'm not writing one now. Maybe after the doomsday.
</p>

<p> 
If you too are a newbie, but know a bit of php, I recommend textpattern, else Joomla is your engine. 
</p>
<p>And the spelling mistake was intentional.</p>
