&#8220; <span class="drupal">Drupal</span> is the most efficient CMS ever &#8221;, &#8220; <span class="joomla">Joomla</span> is most powerful &#8221;, 
&#8220; There's nothing like <span class="wordpress">Wordpress</span> &#8221;. Frankly speaking, all such reviews make me shout, &#8220; WTF &#8221;.

I'm 15, (a great excuse), and I had just heard of a thing called CMS, but never knew what it was, or what its use was. All I knew was html and CSS. 
Thanks to Sir Tim for my first encounter with CMS. I just got to know that CMS-es are used to manage you site and call in better functionality. I have
never used a CMS before, I don't know what it looks like, all I know is that I'm eager to learn something new.
