<div class="info">About Me</div> 
<span class="extra">Likes, dislikes, etsectra ..</span> 
<p>I'm just a bunch of awesome random thoughts, always racing over my head .
I'm 15, and an aspiring programmer (although not that good). I love football,
play center strike for my school team, barca my 'MES EN QUE CLUB', Messi my god . I don't know 
what nerds mean. I won't tell
you that I have accidentlly been <del>naked</del><ins> in a towel</ins> in 
front of 'bout 4 girls. Oh! damn, I told you. I always keep a plan 'B'
because I never make a plan 'A'.

<div class="article"> 
<div class="info">Mission,passion</div> 
<span class="extra">dreams, desires, stuff..</span> 
<p>I'm passionate about football, programming, and web development. I'm always busy
in brain storming, and I'll start a company that works for <a href="#" class="this">this
<span class="this_span">Web Designers, Programmers, Freelancers, Developers ..</span></a> community. My enterprise 
will make next-gen,"Never thought of never heard of stuff".

<span class="extra">People and brands who helped me</span> 
<p>There are a lot of good people on the planet who are ready to help you for absolutely no reason. They deserve a BIG applause.
Here are some who helped me:

<p><a href="http://www.zymic.com">Zymic</a>, for providing me hosting support.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.amrindersandhu.com">Amrinder Sandhu</a>, for adding me as friends at facebook. I also used the css for twitter and facebook, as on his website.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.meyerweb.com">Eric Meyer</a>, for creating reset.css. I used it for my website.</p>

<span class="extra">the superhero to the rescue</span> 
<p>The guy in black is me. We wanted to reach that tree. I could have used my rocket, lying in my bag pack, but I didn't, so that 
my friends don't feel bad, that they can't fly.
